Significant changes were made to the program. First IntEnum was imported from enum, so that each choice is associated with
a number. A class Action was also created to group choices into their own namespaces to make the code more expressive. This way 
comparisons are more efficant and straightforward. The choice is kid proofed to ensure that the user puts in correct input
a number between 0 and 2 inclusive.

Defined a get user selection fucntion that asks the user to input their choice among rock paper and scissors. Each chocie is associated with a number for comparison purposes.

Defined get computer selection which randomly assigns the computer either rock paper or scissors. Again each choice is associated
with a number for comparison purposes.

Defined determine winner function that takes the user choice and computer choice as parameters, compares the two, and determines the 
winner based on the rules of rock paper scissors.
